## Integration of Kedro with MLflow as Kedro DataSet and Hooks (callbacks)

### How to use MLflow from Kedro projects

Kedro DataSet and Hooks (callbacks) are provided to use MLflow without adding any MLflow-related code in the node (task) functions.

- Kedro DataSet
  - `pipelinex.MLflowDataSet`(https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex/blob/master/src/pipelinex/extras/datasets/mlflow/mlflow_dataset.py)
  
    Kedro Dataset that saves data to or loads data from MLflow. Set `dataset` argument as follows.

    - If `dataset` is set to a Kedro DataSet object or a dictionary, it will be saved/loaded as an MLFlow artifact.
    - If `dataset` is set to a string either {"json", "csv", "xls", "parquet", "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "img", "pkl", "txt", "yml", "yaml"}, Kedro DataSet object will be created with the string as the file extension and will be saved/loaded as an MLflow artifact. Under the hood, the following Kedro DataSet classes will be used (inspired by [Kedro Wings](https://github.com/tamsanh/kedro-wings)).
      ```python
      dataset_dicts = {
        "json": {"type": "json.JSONDataSet"},
        "csv": {"type": "pandas.CSVDataSet"},
        "xls": {"type": "pandas.ExcelDataSet"},
        "parquet": {"type": "pandas.ParquetDataSet"},
        "pkl": {"type": "pickle.PickleDataSet"},
        "png": {"type": "pillow.ImageDataSet"},
        "jpg": {"type": "pillow.ImageDataSet"},
        "jpeg": {"type": "pillow.ImageDataSet"},
        "img": {"type": "pillow.ImageDataSet"},
        "txt": {"type": "text.TextDataSet"},
        "yaml": {"type": "yaml.YAMLDataSet"},
        "yml": {"type": "yaml.YAMLDataSet"},
      }
      ``` 
    - If `dataset` is set to a string "p", the value will be saved/loaded as an MLflow parameter (string).
    - If `dataset` is set to a string "m", the value will be saved/loaded as an MLflow metric (numeric). 
    - If `dataset` is set to None (default), MLflow will not be used.

  MLflow-ready Kedro projects can be generated by the [Kedro starters](https://github.com/Minyus/kedro-starters-sklearn) (Cookiecutter template) which include the following example config:

  ```yaml
  # catalog.yml

  # Write a pickle file & upload to MLflow
  model:
    type: pipelinex.MLflowDataSet
    dataset: pkl

  # Write a csv file & upload to MLflow
  pred_df: 
    type: pipelinex.MLflowDataSet
    dataset: csv

  # Write an MLflow metric
  score:
    type: pipelinex.MLflowDataSet
    dataset: m  
  ```

  ```python
  # catalog.py (alternative to catalog.yml)

  catalog_dict = {
    "model": MLflowDataSet(dataset="pkl"),  # Write a pickle file & upload to MLflow
    "pred_df": MLflowDataSet(dataset="csv"),  # Write a csv file & upload to MLflow
    "score": MLflowDataSet(dataset="m"),  # Write an MLflow metric
  }
  ```

  ```python
  # mlflow_config.py 

  import pipelinex

  mlflow_hooks = (
    pipelinex.MLflowBasicLoggerHook(
        enable_mlflow=True,  # Enable configuring and logging to MLflow
        uri="sqlite:///mlruns/sqlite.db",
        experiment_name="experiment_001",
        artifact_location="./mlruns/experiment_001",
        offset_hours=0,  # Specify the offset hour (e.g. 0 for UTC/GMT +00:00) to log in MLflow
    ),  # Configure and log duration time for the pipeline
    pipelinex.MLflowArtifactsLoggerHook(
        enable_mlflow=True,  # Enable logging to MLflow
        filepaths_before_pipeline_run=[
            "conf/base/parameters.yml"
        ],  # Optionally specify the file paths to log before pipeline is run
        filepaths_after_pipeline_run=[
            "data/06_models/model.pkl"
        ],  # Optionally specify the file paths to log after pipeline is run
    ),  # Log artifacts of specified file paths and dataset names
    pipelinex.MLflowDataSetsLoggerHook(
        enable_mlflow=True,  # Enable logging to MLflow
    ),  # Log output datasets of (list of) float, int, and str classes
    pipelinex.MLflowTimeLoggerHook(
        enable_mlflow=True,  # Enable logging to MLflow
    ),  # Log duration time to run each node (task)
    pipelinex.AddTransformersHook(
        transformers=[
            pipelinex.MLflowIOTimeLoggerTransformer(
                enable_mlflow=True
            )  # Log duration time to load and save each dataset
        ],
    ),  # Add transformers
  )

### Comparison with `kedro-mlflow` package

Both [PipelineX](https://pipelinex.readthedocs.io/) and [kedro-mlflow](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/) provide integration of MLflow to Kedro. 
Here are the comparisons.

- Features supported by both PipelineX and kedro-mlflow
  - Kedro DataSets and Hooks to log (save/upload) artifacts, parameters, and metrics to MLflow.
  - Truncate MLflow parameter values to 250 characters to avoid error due to MLflow parameter length limit.
  - Dict values can be flattened using dot (".") as the separator to log each value inside the dict separately.

- Features supported by only PipelineX
  - [Time logging] Option to log execution time for each task (Kedro node) as MLflow metrics
  - [Gantt logging] Option to log Gantt chart HTML file that visualizes execution time using Plotly as an MLflow artifact (inspired by [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/ui.html#gantt-chart))
  - [Automatic backend Kedro DataSets for common artifacts] Option to specify a common file extension ({"json", "csv", "xls", "parquet", "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "img", "pkl", "txt", "yml", "yaml"}) so the Kedro DataSet object will be created behind the scene instead of manually specifying a Kedro DataSet including filepath in the catalog (inspired by [Kedro Wings](https://github.com/tamsanh/kedro-wings#default-datasets)).
  - [Automatic logging for MLflow parameters and metrics] Option to log each dataset not listed in the catalog as MLflow parameter or metric, instead of manually specifying a Kedro DataSet in the catalog.
    - If the data type is either {float, int}, the value will be saved/loaded 
    as an MLflow metric.
    - If the data type is either {str, list, tuple, set}, the value will be 
    saved/load as an MLflow parameter.
    - If the data type is dict, the value will be flattened with dot (".") as
    the separator and then saved/loaded as either an MLflow metric or parameter 
    based on each data type as explained above. 
    - For example, `"data_loading_config": {"train": {"batch_size": 32}}` will be logged as MLflow metric of `"data_loading_config.train.batch_size": 32`)
  - [Flexible config per DataSet] For each Kedro DataSet, it is possible to configure differently. For example, a dict value can be logged as an MLflow parameter (string) as is while another one can be logged as an MLflow metric after being flattened.
  - [Direct artifact logging] Option to specify the paths of any data to log as MLflow artifacts after Kedro pipeline runs without using a Kedro DataSet, which is useful if you want to save local files (e.g. info/warning/error log files, intermediate model weights saved by Machine Learning packages such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, etc.) 
  - [Environment Variable logging] Option to log Environment Variables
  - [Downloading] Option to download MLflow artifacts, params, metrics from an existing MLflow experiment run using the Kedro DataSet
  - [Up to date] Support for Kedro 0.17.0 (released in Dec 2020) or later 

- Features provided by only kedro-mlflow
  - A wrapper for MLflow's `log_model`
  - Configure MLflow logging in a YAML file
  - Option to use MLflow tag or raise error if MLflow parameter values exceed 250 characters
