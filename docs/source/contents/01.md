## Introduction

PipelineX is a Python package designed to make Machine Learning projects efficient with modular, reusable, and easy-to-use features for experimentation.

Please refer [here](https://github.com/Minyus/Python_Packages_for_Pipeline_Workflow) to find out how PipelineX differs from other pipeline/workflow packages: Airflow, Luigi, Gokart, Metaflow, and Kedro.

PipelineX provides [enhancements for YAML/JSON](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex#pythonic-enhanced-yamljson) useful for parameter management summarized as follows.

- Import-less Python object: Include (nested) Python classes and functions in a YAML/JSON file
- Anchor-less aliasing: Look up another key in the same YAML/JSON file
- Python expression in YAML/JSON files

PipelineX provides [enhancements](https://github.com/Minyus/pipelinex#yamlconfigurable-enhanced-kedro) for [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro) summarized as follows.

- Integration with [MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)
- Kedro pipeline/DAG definition in a YAML/JSON file with more options
- Additional Kedro-compatible data interface sets ("DataSets") for Computer Vision applications
- Additional decorators for benchmarking

PipelineX includes integration with the following Python packages.

- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- [Ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite)
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python)
- [Memory Profiler](https://github.com/pythonprofilers/memory_profiler)
- [NVIDIA Management Library](https://github.com/gpuopenanalytics/pynvml)

These wrappers are all independent and optional. You do _not_ need to install all of these Python packages.

PipelineX shares similar philosophy/concepts with:

- Parameter/Config management packages: [OmegaConf](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf), 
[Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra), [Jsonnet](https://github.com/google/jsonnet), [ytt](https://github.com/k14s/ytt)


PipelineX shares similar API styles with 

- Domain-specific packages: [Allennlp](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp), [Ludwig](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/), [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)
