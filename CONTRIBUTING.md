## Coding Style (appreceated, but optional)

- Formatting by [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
- [PEP 484 type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
- [Google docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Compatibility with Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 while Python 3.7 is the recommended version.
- For string formatting, use [str.format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) method rather than [f-strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#id13) to keep compatibility with Python 3.5
